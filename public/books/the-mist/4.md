Billy began to act hysterical and tantrummy, screaming for his mother in a hoarse, demanding way through his tears, instantly regressing to the age of two. Snot was lathered on his upper lip. I led him away, walking down one of the middle aisles with my arm around his shoulders, trying to soothe him. I took him back by the long white meat cabinet that ran the length of the store. Mr. McVey, the butcher, was still there. We nodded at each other, the best we could do under the circumstances.

I sat down on the floor and took Billy on my lap and held his face against my chest and rocked him and talked to him. I told him all the lies parents keep in reserve for bad situations, the ones that sound so damn plausible to a child, and I told them in a tone of perfect conviction.

"That's not regular fog," Billy said. He looked up at me, his eyes dark-circled and tear-streaked. "It isn't, is it Daddy?"

"No, I don't think so." I didn't want to lie about that.

Kids don't fight shock the way adults do; they go with it. Billy started to doze off. I held him, thinking he might snap awake again, but his doze deepened into a real sleep. Maybe he had been awake part of the night before, when we had slept three-in-a-bed. And maybe—I felt a cold eddy slip through me at the thought—maybe he had sensed something coming.

When I was sure he was solidly out, I laid him on the floor and went looking for something to cover him up with. Most of the people were still up front, looking out into the thick blanket of mist. Norton had gathered a little crowd of listeners, and was busy spellbinding—or trying to.

I went into the storage area through the big double door between the meat cabinet and the beer cooler.

The generator roared steadily behind its plywood partition, but something had gone wrong. I could smell diesel fumes, and they were much too strong. I walked toward the partition, taking shallow breaths, my shirt pulled up over my mouth and nose.

The storage area was long and narrow, feebly lit by two sets of emergency lights. Cartons were stacked everywhere.

I unlatched the door in the generator partition and stepped through. The machine was obscured in drifting, oily clouds of blue smoke. The exhaust pipe ran out through a hole in the wall. Something must have blocked off the outside end. There was a simple on/off switch and I flipped it. The generator hitched, coughed, and died.

The emergency lights faded out and I was left in darkness.

I got scared very quickly, and I got disoriented. My breathing sounded like a low wind rattling in straw. I bumped my nose on the flimsy plywood door going out and my heart lurched. I got off course and ran into a stack of bleach cartons. They tumbled and fell. I tripped over another carton that had landed behind me and fell down, thumping my head hard enough to see bright stars.

I lay there cursing myself and rubbing my head, telling myself to just take it easy, get back to Billy, telling myself nothing soft and slimy was going to close over my ankle or slip into one groping hand. I told myself not to lose control.

I stood up carefully, looking for a pencil line of light between the double doors. I found it, a faint but unmistakable scratch on the darkness. I started toward it, and then stopped.

There was a sound.

A soft sliding sound. It stopped, then started again with a stealthy little bump.

Everything inside me went loose. I regressed magically to four years of age. That sound wasn't coming from the market. It was coming from behind me. From outside. Where the mist was.

Something that was slipping and sliding and scraping over the cinderblocks. And, maybe, looking for a way in.

Or maybe it was already in, and it was looking for me.

It came again. I was positive it was outside. But that didn't make it any better. My legs refused the order to go.

Then the quality of the noise changed. Something rasped across the darkness.

My heart leaped in my chest and I lunged at that thin vertical line of light. I hit the doors straight-arm and burst through into the market.

Three or four people were right outside—Ollie Weeks was one of them—and they all jumped back. Ollie grabbed at his chest.

"David!" he said in a pinched voice. "Jesus Christ, you want to take ten years off my—" He saw my face. "What's the matter with you?"

"Did you hear it?" I asked. My voice sounded high and squeaking. "Did any of you hear it?"

They hadn't heard anything, of course. They had come up to see why the generator had gone off. As Ollie told me that, one of the bag-boys bustled up with an armload of flashlights. He looked from Ollie to me curiously.

"I turned the generator off," I said, and explained why.

"What did you hear?" one of the other men asked. He worked for the town road department; his name was Jim something.

"I don't know. A scraping noise. Slithery. I don't want to hear it again."

"Nerves," the other fellow with Ollie said.

"No. It was not nerves."

Ollie opened the doors and chocked them, letting in some light. The bleach cartons lay scattered around. The fellow named Jim sniffed and said, "Smells pretty rank, all right. Guess you was right to shut her down."

The flashlight beams bobbed and danced across cartons of canned goods, toilet paper, dog food. The beams were smoky in the drifting fumes. The bag-boy trained his light briefly on the wide loading door at the extreme right.

The two men and Ollie went inside the generator compartment.

The bag-boy was walking toward the loading door, flashing his light ahead of him.

"I wouldn't go over there," I said.

"No, I know you wouldn't."

The generator wheezed, then roared.

"Jesus! Shut her down! Holy crow, don't that stink!"

The generator died again.

The bag-boy walked back from the loading door just as they came out. "Something's plugged that exhaust, all right," one of the men said.

"I'll tell you what," the bag-boy said. His eyes were shining. "Get it running long enough for me to raise the loading door back there. I'll go around and clear away whatever it is."

"Norm, I don't think that's a very good idea," Ollie said doubtfully.

"Don't worry," the other guy said indulgently to Ollie, dismissing him.

Norm, the bag-boy, was indignant. "Listen, it was my idea," he said.

All at once they had gotten around to arguing about *who* was going to do it instead of *if* it should be done at all. But of course, none of them had heard that nasty slithering sound.

"Stop it!" I said loudly. They looked around at me. "You don't seem to understand. This is no ordinary fog. If you open that loading door and something comes in—"

"Something like what?" Norm said with perfect eighteen-year-old macho contempt.

"Whatever made the noise I heard."

"Mr. Drayton," Jim said. "Pardon me, but I'm not convinced you heard anything... Way I figure, you got in here in the dark and maybe you just... got a little confused."

"Maybe I did," I said. "And maybe if you want to start screwing around outside, you ought to start by making sure that lady got home safe to her kids."

"Hey," Jim's buddy said. "When any of us here want your advice, we'll ask for it."

Hesitantly, Ollie said: "The generator really isn't that important, you know. The food in the cold cases will keep for twelve hours or more with absolutely no—"

"Okay, kid, you're it," Jim said brusquely. "I'll start the motor, you raise the door. Me and Myron will be standing by the exhaust outflow. Give us a yell when it's clear."

"Sure," Norm said, and bustled excitedly away.

"Norm," I said. "Don't be a fool."

"It's a mistake," Ollie added.

He looked at us, and suddenly his face was much younger than eighteen. It was the face of a boy. His Adam's apple bobbed. I saw that he was scared green. He opened his mouth to say something—I think he was going to call it off—and then the generator roared into life again. When it was running smoothly, Norm lunged at the button to the right of the door and it began to rattle upward.

The storage area began to fill with the mellow white light of an overcast late-winter day.

The loading door went up two feet, then four. Beyond I could see a square cement platform. The fog was incredibly thick.

"Hold up!" Norm yelled.

Tendrils of mist, as white and fine as floating lace, eddied inside. The air was cold. It was like March. I shivered.

The generator died. Jim came out just as Norm ducked under the door.

He saw it. So did I. So did Ollie.

A tentacle came over the far lip of the concrete loading platform and grabbed Norm around the calf.

My mouth dropped wide open. Ollie made a very short glottal sound of surprise—*uk!*

The tentacle was slate gray on top, shading to a fleshy pink underneath. And there were rows of suckers on the underside. They were moving and writhing like hundreds of small, puckering mouths.

Norm looked down. He saw what had him. His eyes bulged. "Get it off me! Hey, get it off me! Christ Jesus, get this frigging thing off me!"

"Oh my God," Jim whimpered.

Norm grabbed the bottom edge of the loading door and yanked himself back in. The tentacle seemed to bulge. Norm was yanked back against the corrugated steel door—his head clanged against it. The tentacle bulged more, and Norm's legs and torso began to slip back out.

"Help me," he was sobbing. "Help me, you guys, please, please."

"Jesus, Mary and Joseph," Myron said.

I was the closest, and I grabbed Norm around the waist and yanked as hard as I could. For a moment we moved backward, but only for a moment. Then three more tentacles floated out of the mist towards us. One curled around Norm's flapping red Federal apron and tore it away.

The other two tentacles slithered aimlessly back and forth on the loading platform. Then one of them slapped against Norm's left hip and slipped around it. I felt it touch my arm. It was warm and pulsing and smooth. The third tentacle ringleted his other ankle.

Now he was being pulled away from me. "Help me!" I shouted. "Ollie! Someone! Give me a hand here!"

But they didn't come.

I looked down and saw the tentacle around Norm's waist working into his skin. The suckers were eating him. Blood, as red as his missing apron, began to seep out of the trench the pulsing tentacle had made.

Norm's legs were outside again. One of his loafers had fallen off. A new tentacle came out, wrapped its tip firmly around the shoe, and made off with it. Norm's fingers clutched at the door's lower edge. He had it in a death grip. He was not screaming anymore. His head whipped back and forth in an endless gesture of negation, his long black hair flying wildly.

I looked over his shoulder and saw more tentacles coming, dozens of them, a forest of them. Most were small but a few were gigantic. One of these big ones struck the concrete loading platform with a loud and rolling *thrrrrp!* sound and moved sluggishly toward us like a great blind earthworm.

One of the tentacles brushed delicately past my cheek and then wavered in the air, as if debating.

I thought of Billy then. Billy was lying asleep in the market. If one of those things got hold of me, there would be no one to watch out for him.

So I let go of Norm and dropped to my hands and knees.

I was half in and half out, directly under the raised door. A tentacle passed by on my left. It attached itself to one of Norm's bulging upper arms, paused for a second, and then slid around it in coils.

Now Norm looked like something out of a madman's dream of snake charming. Tentacles twisted over him almost everywhere… and they were all around me, as well.

I made a clumsy leapfrog jump back inside, landed on my shoulder, and rolled. Jim, Ollie and Myron were still there. They stood like a tableau of waxworks, their faces pale, their eyes too bright.

"Start the generator!" I yelled at them.

Neither moved.

I groped on the floor, picked up a box of Snowy bleach, and chucked it at Jim. It hit him in the gut. He grunted and grabbed at himself. His eyes flickered back into some semblance of normality.

"Go start that fucking generator!" I screamed.

He didn't move. "I'm sorry," he whined. "I didn't know, how the hell was I supposed to know?"

So then Ollie moved, bunting him aside and blundering into the generator room. Seconds later the generator coughed and rumbled into life.

I turned back to the loading door. Norm was almost gone, yet he clung grimly with one hand. His body boiled with tentacles, and blood pattered serenely down on the concrete. His eyes met mine for a moment. They were hellishly bright and aware. He knew what was happening to him.

Then he was pulled, bumping and rolling, into the mist. There was another scream, choked off. Norm was gone.

I looked around for something long enough to reach the SHUT button. I saw a janitor's push broom and grabbed it. I pushed the tip of the handle onto the button and the motor whined. The door began to slide back down.

It touched the thickest of the tentacles first. It pierced its hide. A black goo began to spurt from it. It writhed madly, whipping across the floor like an obscene bullwhip, and then it was gone. The others began to withdraw.

One of them had a five-pound bag of Gaines dog food, and it wouldn't let go. The descending door cut it in two. The severed chunk of tentacle squeezed convulsively, splitting the bag open. Then it began to flop on the floor like a fish out of water, curling and uncurling, until it lay still.

There was no sound except the roar of the generator and Ollie, crying inside the plywood compartment. Then I became aware of another sound. The soft, slithery sound I had heard in the dark. Only now the sound was multiplied tenfold. It was the sound of tentacles squirming over the outside of the loading door, trying to find a way in.

Myron took a couple of steps towards me. "Look," he said. "You got to understand—"

I looped a fist at his face. He was too surprised to even try to block it. Blood flowed into his mouth.

"You got him killed!" I shouted. "Did you get a good look at it? Did you get a good look at what you did?"

I started to pummel him, throwing wild rights and lefts. He stepped back, taking the punches with a numbness that seemed like a kind of penance. That made me angrier. I bloodied his nose. I raised a mouse under one of his eyes. I clipped him a hard one on the chin.

"Look," he kept saying, "look, look," and then I punched him low in the stomach and the air went out of him and he didn't say "look, look" anymore. I don't know how long I would have gone on, but someone grabbed my arms. I jerked free and turned around.

It was Ollie, his round face dead pale. "Don't, David," he said. "Don't hit him anymore. It doesn't solve anything."

Jim was standing off to one side, his face a bewildered blank.

"You and your buddy are a couple of stupid assholes," I said. "You two assholes got that kid killed."

I was breathing hard. The blood was roaring in my ears. I sat down on a couple of cartons and put my head down between my knees, waiting to see if I was going to black out or puke or what. After a bit the feeling began to pass.

"Okay," I said dully to Ollie. "I'm done."

"Good," Ollie said. "We've got to think what to do next."

The storage area was beginning to stink of exhaust again.

"Shut the generator down. That's the first thing."

"Yeah, let's get out of here," Myron said. His eyes appealed to me. "I'm sorry about the kid. But you got to understand—"

"I don't got to understand anything. You and your buddy go back into the market, but you wait right there by the beer cooler. And don't say a word to anybody. Not yet."

They went willingly enough. Ollie killed the generator, and just as the lights started to fail, I saw a quilted mover's rug. I reached up and grabbed it for Billy.

There was the shuffling sound of Ollie coming out of the generator compartment.

"David?" His voice wavered a little. "You still here?"

"Right here, Ollie."

He reached out of the dark and gripped my shoulder. He gave a long, trembling sigh. "Christ, let's get out of here. This dark is... is bad."

"It is," I said. "But hang tight a minute, Ollie. I wanted to talk to you."

"Dave... they didn't twist Norm's arm. You ought to remember that."

"Norm was a kid, and they weren't. But never mind, that's over. We've got to tell them, Ollie. The people in the market."

"If they panic—" Ollie's voice was doubtful.

"Maybe they will and maybe they won't. But it will make them think twice about going out. We have to make them understand what they're risking."

His hand was gripping my arm hard. "All right," he said. "Yes. I just keep asking myself... all those tentacles... like a squid or something... David, what were they hooked to? What were those tentacles hooked to?"

"I don't know. But I don't want those two telling people on their own. That would start a panic. Let's go."

We started to shuffle toward the thin line of light between the swing doors.

As we reached them, Ollie said flatly: "What we saw... it's impossible, David. You know that, don't you?"

"Yes," I said. "That's right."

"So what happened? Huh? What happened? What is that damned mist?"

"Ollie, I don't know."

We went out.
